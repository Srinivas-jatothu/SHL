## User Flow

1. User navigates to the Assessment Recommender web application
2. User selects input method (text or URL)
3. For text input:
   - User enters or pastes job description
   - User clicks "Find Assessments" button
4. For URL input:
   - User enters job posting URL
   - User clicks "Find Assessments" button
5. System processes input and analyzes content
6. System matches job requirements against assessment database
7. System displays ranked recommendations in a table
8. User can click on assessment names to visit SHL catalog pages
9. User can modify input and search again as needed

This approach ensures a systematic development process that focuses on accuracy, usability, and maintainability of the Assessment Recommender system.
